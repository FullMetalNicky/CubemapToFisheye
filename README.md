# CubemapToFisheye
Working with Unity, I was in dire need of an accurate, and near real-time simulation of fisheye lense. Since a lot of computer vision projects use OpenCV to calibrate their cameras, I decided to use OpenCV's fisheye distortion model. Despite it's many flaws, this model is very popular so it seemed like a good choice to implement this effect accordingly. To simulate the fisheye effect as efficiently as possible, first I build a look-up table (LUT) using a C++ code, and then I use it in a compute shader in Unity.

## OpenCV Fisheye Distortion Model
As you probably know, in a fisheye lense straight lines appear curved. Just like getting drunk, where there are many ways in which you go from a functioning human being to a pitiful, drooling mess curled on the floor, it works similarily with straight lines and fisheyes. The model in which OpenCV transforms lines is an equidistant fisheye projection, with perturbations.

Instead of using the ideal model

                        r = f * θ 
                        
OpenCV suggests a more realistic approach by modelling the angel as a series:

                        θd=θ * (1 + k1 * θ2 + k2 * θ4 + k3 * θ6 + k4 * θ8)
                        r = f * θd
                        
Where (k1, k2, k3, k4) are the fisheye's distortion coefficients. 

## The Magic of Cubemaps
Cubemaps are like social media. You think there is a whole world around you, but it's just six stupid faces structured as a box with you in the center, and you're too dumb to realize it's a facade. It's basically a very efficient way of environmental mapping and it's excessively used in computer graphics. A cubemap is generated by rendering 6 views from the same point - the view directions are on 3 orthogonal axes (e.g. +x, +y, +z, -x, -y, -z), and each view has a frustum of 90°.

Unity offers a class that renders cubemaps for you, and it's probably more efficient than the one I wrote, but it's limited to cubemaps that are aligned with the Cartesian axes. So if you want to model a tilted camera, you're fucked. 

## Building LUTs in C++
Currently, I don't have a CMake. So you can use my .sln/.vcxproj files in VS2017, or take the source files and create a new porject in whatever IDE. Just make sure you link it with OpenCV. 

In orer to create a LUT, you will need to provide LUT builder with an intrisic matrix (k) in a CV_64F format (double), a vector of 4 doubles for the distortionn coeeficients (cv::Vec4d), the resolution of the lense that matches these calibration paramaters and the resolution of the cubemap faces. Cubemap face resolution must be a square and a power of 2.
LUTs can be saved to a folder as binary files, and also be read from binary files.

MIT, I think. But if you buy me a 6-pack of diet coke I won't complain.
